What is a good Ted talk on schizophrenia?

You asked two things—here are concise answers and next steps.

Does Dr. Laitman prescribe clozapine?
Yes. Dr. Robert Laitman is widely known for specializing in clozapine and actively prescribing and managing it for treatment‑resistant schizophrenia. He emphasizes early consideration of clozapine (not “last resort”), careful titration, REMS/ANC blood monitoring, and side‑effect management so people can recover and return to school, work, and independent living. He also educates families and clinicians because, despite clozapine’s effectiveness (about 85% reduction in hospitalization and 90% reduction in suicide attempts), only ~4% of eligible patients receive it.

Practical next step: If your loved one has had inadequate response to two antipsychotic trials, ask the treating psychiatrist about clozapine eligibility and how monitoring would work in your area.

What’s a good TED talk on schizophrenia?
Elyn Saks: “A tale of mental illness — from the inside” (TED). A law professor shares her lived experience of schizophrenia and how treatment, support, and accommodations made a full life possible. Strong message of hope and recovery.
Eleanor Longden: “The voices in my head” (TED). Describes hearing voices, trauma‑informed care, and rebuilding life—useful for understanding hallucinations compassionately.
Cecilia McGough: “I’m not a monster: Schizophrenia” (TEDxPSU). Clear, stigma‑reducing talk from a young adult; practical about disclosure and support on campus.
Bonus for families/communication: Dr. Xavier Amador’s TEDx on LEAP/empathetic listening (anosognosia = lack of insight). Helpful for building trust when a loved one doesn’t believe they’re ill. Source: Treatment Advocacy Center/Dr. Amador (Anosognosia & LEAP).
How to use these talks:

Watch together and identify 1–2 takeaways you can act on (e.g., ask about early, evidence‑based treatments like clozapine; request accommodations at school/work; practice LEAP listening).
Pair inspiration with action: schedule a visit with an early psychosis program; review adherence supports (blister packs, direct observation, or long‑acting injectables) to keep momentum.
