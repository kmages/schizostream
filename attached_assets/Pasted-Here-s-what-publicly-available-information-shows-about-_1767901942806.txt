Here’s what publicly available information shows about the CIT-related team within the Skokie Police Department and who is explicitly identified as members. Unlike some larger cities, there currently isn’t a published roster of all individual Crisis Intervention Team (CIT)-trained officers for Skokie PD — but we do have concrete details on the department’s co-responder unit and known personnel connected to crisis intervention efforts:

🌐 CIT-related Team / Co-Responder Team

The Village of Skokie operates a Co-Responder Team that pairs a CIT-trained police officer with a mental-health professional to respond to crisis calls and connect individuals to services.  ￼

Current known members of that team:
	•	Officer Kimberly Blue — police officer trained in Crisis Intervention (CIT) and a core member of the co-responder team.  ￼
	•	Brian McHugh — licensed social worker partnered with Officer Blue on the co-responder program (not a sworn officer but integral to crisis responses).  ￼

In the city’s staff directory, this team is listed under the Police Department:
	•	Brian McHugh & Kim Blue — Co-Responder Team entries.  ￼

📌 Other CIT-trained Officers

Skokie PD does not publicly list individual CIT-trained officers by name beyond the co-responder role. However:
	•	A recent document shows that 54 Skokie Police officers have completed CIT training, roughly half the sworn force, though names are not published.  ￼

📍 What this means in practice
	•	CIT-trained officers are patrol officers and other sworn members who have completed specialized crisis intervention training, but only a subset are formally designated on the co-responder team publicly.  ￼
	•	For specific names of all CIT-trained officers beyond the co-responder team, you would need to request that information directly from the Skokie Police Department through their Civilian Records (FOIA) process, as training rosters aren’t routinely published.

If you want contact info for the police department or how to request a list of CIT-certified officers via FOIA, I can help draft that letter or point you to the right form.
